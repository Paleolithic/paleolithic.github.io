			<h3>Who</h3>
			<p>I am personally inviting you to be apart of a very special occasion, my proposal to Amy Halloran. I am inviting her closest friends, family, and other individuals who would like to opportunity to be part of this flashmob. I require this be kept a <span class="bold">SECRET</span> to Amy. I do not want her to know that this would be coming. I need for you all also to read all of this webpage to get a sense of what I need from you as a participant.</p>

			<h3>What</h3>
			<p> For those who don’t know what a flashmob is:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<span class="bold word-descriptor">flash mob</span>
					<span class="italics word-descriptor">noun</span>
					a large public gathering at which people perform an unusual or seemingly random act and then disperse, typically organized by means of the Internet or social media.
				</blockquote>
			<p>
			I plan on proposing to Amy through a flashmob song. I also need several people who can commit time and effort to trying to help me coordinate this. If you are interested in being part of the event or would like to be a participant (performer, photographer, videographer, etc) please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_RoSkPGuHlv8L6hh_f_MJwXa1ehHe1M-WBTJbggxgac/viewform">click here.</a></p>

			<h3>When</h3>
			<p>October 3, 2014. 6:30 - 7:00 PM. This is a Friday evening event. This date is special to us since this is around the same time last year that we decided to be “officially” together. The date we actually made it official is September 29, but I like being a master of surprises to Amy so lets try keeping her on her toes by having it a week later.</p>

			<div class='descriptor-image'><img src='assets/images/lightbulb.png'/></div>
			<h3>Why</h3>
			<p>It was serendipity that fated us meeting, but the universe can go only so far to bring two people together. It is more than a feeling that I believe in my heart, in my soul, that we are meant to be together. I hope you are as happy and excited as I am to do this. Please join me in making this moment as special as it can be!

			<h3>Photographer</h3>
			<p>
				I still need at least someone to volunteer to be a photographer during the event. To be a photographer you would need to have your own equipment, and also get there early and stay later to document everything. If I can have a few people who can help me out that would be great!!!

			<h3>Singers</h3>
			<p>
				 My awesome friend Michelle Whitescarver arranged an amazing version of the song I would like to Flashmob:

				Here is the original song:
				<iframe width="285" height="214" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zwFS69nA-1w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				We are doing a shortened version of this song. I will be doing a speech during the flash mob, and will require you guys to sing while i talk. The downloads section has all of the sheet music and audio that michelle created. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="one-third column participant">
			<h3>Videographer</h3>
			<p>
				I also need someone who would be able to record the whole thing. I don’t need anything professional, just a steady hand and your own equipment (can be done also the photographer). If you can do this or know someone who can do this, that would be awesome.

		So what I was thinking was to possibly have a mass skype to go over the score for practicing a week before the event, its a rather simple song, and most of you will just need to do melody (following the violin). Section leaders will be brought in to make sure we have all of the parts accounted for.
